# HW5-WorkdayPlanner
A simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app runs in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

## Installation

Just download and run.

## Usage 

To use:

1. Type in to-do item in the input corresponding to your desired time to complete the task.
2. Save your to-do by clicking on the corresponding save button (blue button with a down arrow icon). This will save your to-do in the local storage of your browser, so it'll remember it the next time you come back to the site.
3. To clear your to-do, simply delete the to-do text from the input and press the corresponding save button. This will ensure that your to-do will not be there the next time you return to the site.

COLOR KEY for timeboxes:
Grey - This hour has already past today
Red - This is the current hour
Green - This hour is in the future
